# Udacity Feed Reader Testing


This is project #4 of Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree. In this project, I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The application has incomplete Jasmine test suites, and I write the remaining test suites and get them to pass. The goal is to learn about JavaScript testing, which is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard known as "test-driven development" or TDD.

## How to Run the Application

1. You can download or clone this repository.

2. Find the `index.html` file, and open the file in a modern browser.

3. The Jasmine tests are displayed at the bottom of the index.html page. 

4. Open the `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` file to start editing the test suites.
